# Exercise Week 8

## Consume a RESTful Web Service in Java

### Instructions

Let's practice what we just did in Activity 3 with a service of your choosing! Select the option below that fits you best. Be sure let your instructor know which repository contains this activity.

1. Find a RESTful web service that is interesting to you and consume it using Java in a stand-a-lone project. If you are struggling to find an api to use, feel free to use the PetStore api here.
2. Create a pojo that represents the response from the service.
3. Create a client that calls the service and maps the response to the pojo.
4. Write a unit test to verify the client and pojo work.


## Exercise Submission

To receive credit for this exercise:

To receive credit for the exercise, send your instructor a link to the repository containing your work. Include a screenshot showing the service tests pass. The screenshot/s should be in a screenshot directory at the root of your repository.
